                    <p>
                        XML stands for Extensible Markup Language. It is a markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable. XML is designed to store and transport data in a structured and self-descriptive manner.

                        In XML, data is organized into elements, which are enclosed in tags. Elements can have attributes to provide additional information about the data. XML documents follow a hierarchical structure, forming a tree-like representation.

                        JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is primarily used for developing interactive web applications. It is widely supported by web browsers, making it the de facto language for client-side scripting on the web.

                    <h4>How is JavaScript related to HTML and CSS?</h4>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        JavaScript is closely related to HTML and CSS in web development. It can be embedded in HTML files using script tags to interact with HTML elements and manipulate their content, attributes, and styling. JavaScript can modify CSS styles dynamically, allowing for changes in appearance and behavior of HTML elements. It interacts with the Document Object Model (DOM), enabling the creation, modification, and removal of HTML elements, traversal of the DOM tree, and handling of events triggered by user actions. JavaScript acts as the bridge between HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and provides interactivity, making web pages dynamic and engaging.
